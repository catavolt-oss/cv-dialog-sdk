These definintions have to be hand-tweaked after they are generated by the typescript compiler.  Don't overwrite them directly!

1) The imports must be changed to import for the other 'catavolt' modules
2) a module declaration must be the top-level wrapper
3) the keyword 'declare' should be removed once inside the module wrapper

compare to the existing files to see what needs to be changed.
